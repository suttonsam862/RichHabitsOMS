# Storage Cleanup Utility with Image Asset Traceability

## Overview
Complete image asset traceability system implemented with comprehensive metadata tracking using `image_assets` table for full audit trail of all uploaded images.

## üéØ Image Asset Traceability Features

### Core Metadata Tags
- **`uploaded_by`**: UUID reference to auth.users(id) - tracks who uploaded the image
- **`entity_type`**: Type of entity ('catalog_item', 'order', 'design_task', 'customer', etc.)
- **`entity_id`**: UUID of the specific entity the image belongs to
- **`image_purpose`**: Purpose category ('gallery', 'profile', 'production', 'design', 'logo', etc.)
- **`storage_path`**: Exact path in Supabase Storage for file location
- **`processing_status`**: Current processing state ('completed', 'pending', 'failed')
- **`metadata`**: JSONB field for extensible custom metadata

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE image_assets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  original_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  mime_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  storage_path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  public_url TEXT,
  storage_bucket VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'uploads',
  
  -- Traceability tags
  uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  image_purpose VARCHAR(100),
  
  -- Timestamps and soft delete
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL,
  
  -- Additional metadata
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);
```

## üîß ImageAssetService Integration

### Core Service Methods
- `createImageAsset()` - Create new image record with full traceability
- `getImageAssetsByEntity()` - Retrieve images for specific entities
- `updateImageAsset()` - Update image metadata and tags
- `softDeleteImageAsset()` - Mark image as deleted while preserving audit trail
- `setPrimaryImage()` - Set primary image for entities with proper tracking
- `getStorageStats()` - Generate usage statistics by entity type and purpose

### Enhanced Deletion Process
1. **Legacy Metadata Lookup**: Find image in existing JSONB fields (imageVariants.gallery, production_images, design_files)
2. **Image Asset Lookup**: Check for corresponding record in image_assets table
3. **Storage Path Extraction**: Parse public URL to extract storage path for deletion
4. **Supabase Storage Cleanup**: Remove file from storage bucket
5. **Metadata Synchronization**: Update both legacy JSONB fields and image_assets table
6. **Audit Trail**: Soft delete image_assets record to preserve traceability

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and RLS Policies

### Row Level Security
```sql
-- Users can view images they uploaded or have entity access to
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their uploaded images" ON image_assets
  FOR SELECT USING (
    uploaded_by = auth.uid() OR
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
  );

-- Users can only upload images with their own uploaded_by tag
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload images" ON image_assets
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (uploaded_by = auth.uid());
```

## üìä Usage Analytics and Reporting

### Storage Statistics
- Total images by entity type
- Storage usage by image purpose
- Upload activity by user
- Processing status distribution
- File size analytics and optimization opportunities

### Audit Capabilities
- Track all image operations (upload, update, delete)
- Monitor user activity patterns
- Entity-specific image management
- Compliance reporting for data retention

## üöÄ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. Execute `create-image-assets-table.sql` to create the traceability table
2. Add proper indexes and RLS policies
3. Test ImageAssetService functionality

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Update image upload endpoints to create image_assets records
2. Enhance deletion endpoints to check image_assets table
3. Migrate existing image metadata to new table structure

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Implement storage cleanup utilities
2. Add image processing status tracking
3. Generate comprehensive usage reports

## üîç Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Complete `image_assets` table schema with all traceability fields
- Comprehensive `ImageAssetService` with full CRUD operations
- Enhanced deletion endpoints with image_assets integration
- RLS policies for proper access control
- TypeScript interfaces and type safety

### üîÑ Enhanced Deletion Integration
- Catalog image deletion now checks for image_assets records
- Graceful handling when image_assets table doesn't exist yet
- Preserves audit trail through soft delete functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy JSONB metadata

### üìã Next Steps
1. Create the image_assets table in Supabase using the provided SQL
2. Update image upload endpoints to populate image_assets records
3. Implement storage cleanup utilities for orphaned files
4. Add comprehensive usage analytics dashboard
