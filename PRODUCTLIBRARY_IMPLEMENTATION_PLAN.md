# ProductLibrary Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Database Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Set up core database schema without affecting existing data

### Step 1.1: Create Database Schema
- [ ] Run `product-library-schema.sql` migration
- [ ] Verify tables created successfully
- [ ] Test RLS policies with test user
- [ ] Validate indexes are working

**Testing**: 
```sql
-- Test basic CRUD operations
INSERT INTO product_library (product_name, base_price, created_by) VALUES ('Test Product', 29.99, 'test@example.com');
SELECT * FROM product_library WHERE id = [new_id];
```

### Step 1.2: Backend API Setup
- [ ] Deploy updated `server/routes/api/productLibrary.ts`
- [ ] Register routes in `server/routes.ts`
- [ ] Test all endpoints with Postman/curl
- [ ] Verify authentication works

**Testing**:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" http://localhost:5000/api/products/library
```

## Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Week 2)
**Goal**: Connect existing ProductLibrary component to backend

### Step 2.1: Basic Product Management
- [ ] Test existing ProductLibrary page with real data
- [ ] Implement add product functionality
- [ ] Test search and filtering
- [ ] Verify copy-to-order feature

### Step 2.2: Mockup System
- [ ] Deploy `useProductMockups` hook
- [ ] Add mockup upload component to ProductLibrary
- [ ] Test image upload and storage
- [ ] Implement mockup gallery display

**Testing**: Upload test images and verify they appear in both database and storage.

## Phase 3: Order Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Link products to actual orders for historical tracking

### Step 3.1: Order Linking System
- [ ] Modify order creation to link to library products
- [ ] Test automatic pricing history insertion
- [ ] Verify usage statistics updates
- [ ] Test order-to-product relationship queries

### Step 3.2: Historical Data Migration
- [ ] Create script to migrate existing order items to library
- [ ] Run migration on copy of production data
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Deploy migration script

**Safety**: Always backup before migration. Test on development data first.

## Phase 4: Catalog Integration (Week 4)
**Goal**: Connect ProductLibrary with existing Catalog system

### Step 4.1: Cross-System Links
- [ ] Add "View in Library" links from Catalog
- [ ] Add "Add to Catalog" from Library
- [ ] Test bidirectional navigation
- [ ] Ensure no data duplication

### Step 4.2: Designer Workflow
- [ ] Integrate mockup uploads in design tasks
- [ ] Link design files to library products
- [ ] Test designer approval workflow
- [ ] Verify client approval system

## Phase 5: Production Optimization (Week 5)
**Goal**: Performance tuning and production readiness

### Step 5.1: Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with 1000+ products
- [ ] Verify image loading performance
- [ ] Test search performance with full-text search
- [ ] Optimize database queries

### Step 5.2: Data Validation
- [ ] Add data validation rules
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Verify file upload limits
- [ ] Test concurrent operations

## Rollback Strategy

If any phase fails:
1. **Database**: Keep migration scripts reversible
2. **API**: Feature flags to disable new endpoints
3. **Frontend**: Graceful degradation to mock data
4. **Files**: Backup storage buckets before changes

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All API endpoints return < 500ms
- [ ] Image uploads complete < 30 seconds
- [ ] Search results return < 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Designers can upload mockups successfully
- [ ] Salespeople can browse and copy products
- [ ] Historical pricing data is accurate
- [ ] Order creation workflow unchanged

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Data Loss
- **Mitigation**: All changes tested on development first
- **Backup**: Daily automated backups before each deployment
- **Rollback**: Immediate rollback scripts prepared

### Medium Risk: Performance Impact
- **Mitigation**: Load testing before production
- **Monitoring**: Database query monitoring enabled
- **Scaling**: Supabase auto-scaling configured

### Low Risk: User Adoption
- **Mitigation**: Training documentation provided
- **Support**: Help tooltips in UI
- **Feedback**: User feedback collection system

## Dependencies

### External Services
- **Supabase Storage**: For mockup file storage
- **Supabase Database**: For all data persistence
- **Authentication**: Existing auth system integration

### Internal Systems
- **Catalog System**: Must not break existing functionality
- **Order Management**: Integration points clearly defined
- **Design Tasks**: Mockup workflow integration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test product library API endpoints
describe('ProductLibrary API', () => {
  test('GET /api/products/library returns products', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test full workflow: product creation → mockup upload → order copy
describe('ProductLibrary Workflow', () => {
  test('Complete product lifecycle', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests
```javascript
// Test UI workflows with Playwright
test('ProductLibrary user journey', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to product library
  // Add new product
  // Upload mockup
  // Copy to order
  // Verify data persistence
});
```
