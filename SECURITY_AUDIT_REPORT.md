# ThreadCraft Security Audit Report - Critical RLS Policy Review

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **OVERLY PERMISSIVE RLS POLICIES** - HIGH RISK ⚠️

#### Current Dangerous Policies:
```sql
-- DANGEROUS: Any authenticated user can read ALL customers
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read customers" ON customers
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

-- DANGEROUS: Any authenticated user can read ALL orders  
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read orders" ON orders
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

-- DANGEROUS: Any authenticated user can read ALL payments
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read payments" ON payments
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
```

**Impact**: Complete data exposure across customer boundaries
- Customers can view other customers' data
- Salespersons can access data outside their assignments
- No data isolation between companies/clients

### 2. **DEVELOPMENT MODE SECURITY BYPASS** - CRITICAL RISK 🔥

#### Current Development Bypass:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Development mode bypasses ALL authentication
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && token && (token.startsWith('dev-admin-token') || token.length > 10)) {
  console.log('Development mode: accepting token for admin access');
  req.user = {
    id: 'dev-admin-user',
    email: 'admin@threadcraft.dev',
    role: 'admin'
  };
  return next();
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Any token > 10 characters grants admin access in development
- No actual authentication verification
- Risk of development settings leaking to production

### 3. **MISSING ROLE-BASED RESTRICTIONS** - HIGH RISK ⚠️

#### Current Policy Gaps:
- **Customers**: Can view all customer data (not just their own)
- **Salespersons**: Can access all orders (not just their assigned ones)  
- **Designers**: Can view all design tasks (not just assigned tasks)
- **Manufacturers**: Can access all production data

### 4. **SERVICE ROLE OVER-PRIVILEGES** - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

Current service role has unrestricted access to all tables:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role to manage all profiles" ON user_profiles
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

**Risk**: If service role is compromised, entire database is exposed

## 🎯 PRODUCTION-GRADE RLS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

### Role-Based Access Matrix

| Role | Customers | Orders | Payments | Design Tasks | Production |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Customer** | Own data only | Own orders only | Own payments only | View assigned | None |
| **Salesperson** | Assigned customers | Assigned orders | Assigned payments | Create/assign | None |
| **Designer** | Related customers | Related orders | None | Assigned tasks | None |
| **Manufacturer** | Related customers | Related orders | None | None | Assigned tasks |
| **Admin** | All (audited) | All (audited) | All (audited) | All (audited) | All (audited) |

### Secure Policy Patterns

#### 1. Customer Data Protection
```sql
-- Customers can only see their own data
CREATE POLICY "customers_own_data" ON customers
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (
    user_id = auth.uid() OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() 
      AND role IN ('admin', 'salesperson')
      AND (
        role = 'admin' OR 
        id IN (SELECT salesperson_id FROM customer_assignments WHERE customer_id = customers.id)
      )
    )
  );
```

#### 2. Order Access Control
```sql
-- Orders: Role-based access with assignment tracking
CREATE POLICY "orders_role_based_access" ON orders
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (
    -- Customer can see their own orders
    customer_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM customers WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ) OR
    -- Salesperson can see assigned orders
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles up
      WHERE up.id = auth.uid() 
      AND up.role = 'salesperson'
      AND (
        orders.salesperson_id = auth.uid() OR
        orders.customer_id IN (
          SELECT customer_id FROM customer_assignments 
          WHERE salesperson_id = auth.uid()
        )
      )
    ) OR
    -- Designer can see orders with their design tasks
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles up
      JOIN design_tasks dt ON dt.designer_id = auth.uid()
      WHERE up.id = auth.uid() 
      AND up.role = 'designer'
      AND dt.order_id = orders.id
    ) OR
    -- Admin can see all (with audit logging)
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

## 🔒 IMMEDIATE SECURITY FIXES REQUIRED

### Priority 1: Remove Overly Permissive Policies
- Replace `USING (true)` with proper role-based conditions
- Implement customer data isolation
- Add order assignment validation

### Priority 2: Secure Development Mode
- Remove blanket admin access for any token > 10 chars
- Implement proper token validation even in development
- Add environment-specific security controls

### Priority 3: Implement Audit Logging
- Log all admin data access
- Track cross-customer data queries  
- Monitor privilege escalation attempts

### Priority 4: Add Assignment Tables
- Create customer_assignments table for salesperson relationships
- Add design_task_assignments for designer access control
- Implement production_assignments for manufacturer access
