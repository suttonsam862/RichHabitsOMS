You are ThreadCraft’s AI assistant, now pivoting from development fixes to preparing a production-grade mobile app for App Store deployment. Your goal is to run an **interactive, deeply detailed questionnaire** that uncovers every requirement, hidden snag, and missing piece—both on my side (the developer) and in the code—so that when we build our App Store-ready package there will be zero surprises, no hallucinations, and no “it works on my machine” moments.

Proceed **section by section**, asking me to confirm or supply details before moving on.

## Section 1: Target Platform & Framework

1. Are we shipping a **native mobile app** or a **PWA wrapped in a container** (e.g., Capacitor, Cordova)?  
2. If native, are we using **React Native**, **Expo**, **SwiftUI/Objective-C**, or another stack?  
3. Do we need to share code with our existing React.js codebase or build completely separate?  
4. What version of iOS devices and OS versions must we support?

2. How will **real-time updates** (design tasks, production tasks) translate on mobile?  
3. Will we need **push notifications** for status changes or messages?  
4. How will **authentication** (Supabase Auth) work on mobile? Any OAuth or deep-link flows?

## Section 5: Security & Compliance

1. What **entitlements** or **permissions** are required? (Camera, Photo Library, Notifications)  
2. How will you secure API keys and secrets (keychain, secure storage, not in code)?  
3. Do we need to integrate **Apple Pay** or comply with in-app purchase policies?  
4. What’s our **privacy policy** and how will we display it in the app?

## Section 6: Build & CI/CD Pipeline

1. Which toolchain will you use to generate an iOS build? (Xcode CLI, Fastlane, GitHub Actions)  
2. How will you manage **provisioning profiles**, **certificates**, and **App Store Connect** accounts?  
3. Do you have **automated tests** (unit, integration, E2E) running for mobile builds?  
4. What roll-back or staging strategy will you use (TestFlight, internal builds)?

## Section 7: App Store Connect & Submission

1. What **metadata** will you need? (App name, description, keywords, screenshots, icons)  
2. Do you have high-resolution **app icons** and **launch screens** ready?  
3. What **privacy and content** questions must you answer in App Review?  
4. Will you need to support **App Clips** or **Universal Links**?

## Section 8: Monitoring & Analytics

1. Which **crash reporting** tool will you integrate? (Sentry, Crashlytics, etc.)  
2. What **analytics** do you need? (user events, funnel tracking, session length)  
3. How will you monitor **performance** and **network errors** in production?  

---

## Section 9: Post-Release Maintenance

1. How will you handle **bug fixes** and **patch updates**?  
2. What’s your plan for **feature toggles** or **remote config**?  
3. How will you collect **user feedback** and triage issues?

---

## Section 10: Unknown Unknowns

1. Are there any **third-party SDKs** you plan to add that require special setup?  
2. Do you foresee any **legal** or **regional compliance** issues (GDPR, COPPA)?  
3. What’s the biggest single “I don’t know that I don’t know” risk for this App Store launch?

**Instructions:**  
- Answer each question in turn.  
- Provide code snippets, design assets, or configuration details where relevant.  
- I’ll use your answers to generate precise build pipelines, code-changes, and submission scripts—ensuring zero AI hallucinations and a smooth App Store approval.  

Let’s start with **Section 1: Target Platform & Framework**—what approach are we taking?
