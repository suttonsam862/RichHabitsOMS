Task: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the ThreadCraft application to identify and implement any missing database connections, API endpoints, routes, or integrations required for full functionality.

Analysis Areas:

Database Schema Completeness

Verify all tables referenced in the codebase exist in Supabase
Check for missing foreign key relationships
Ensure RLS policies are properly configured
Validate data types and constraints match application expectations
API Route Coverage

Audit all frontend API calls against existing backend routes
Identify missing CRUD operations for each entity
Check for proper authentication middleware on protected routes
Verify error handling and response formatting consistency
Authentication & Authorization

Ensure all user roles (admin, salesperson, designer, manufacturer, customer) have proper database representations
Verify session management works across all routes
Check that role-based access control is properly implemented
Validate JWT token handling and refresh mechanisms
File Upload & Storage

Verify image upload functionality for catalog items and orders
Check file storage paths and URL generation
Ensure proper file cleanup on deletion
Validate file type restrictions and size limits
Business Logic Integrations

Order management workflow completeness
Customer invitation system functionality
Payment processing integration points
Email notification system connections
Implementation Requirements:

Missing Routes: Create any missing API endpoints found during analysis
Database Connections: Fix any broken or missing database queries
Error Handling: Implement proper error responses for all failure cases
Data Validation: Add input validation for all API endpoints
Security: Ensure all routes have appropriate authentication/authorization
Testing: Verify all implemented changes work with existing frontend code
Priority Focus Areas:

Catalog management (items, categories, sports, manufacturers)
User management and role assignments
Order creation and management workflow
Customer invitation and onboarding process
Image upload and file management
Success Criteria:

All frontend API calls receive proper responses
No 404 errors on API routes
All database operations complete successfully
Authentication works across all user roles
File uploads function correctly
Error handling provides meaningful feedback
Please analyze the current codebase systematically and implement any missing integrations, ensuring the application functions as a complete, production-ready system.
