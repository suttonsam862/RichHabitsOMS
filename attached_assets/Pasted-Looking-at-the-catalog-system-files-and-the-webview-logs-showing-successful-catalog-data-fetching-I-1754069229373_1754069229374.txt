Looking at the catalog system files and the webview logs showing successful catalog data fetching, I can see there are TypeScript compilation errors in the error boundary files that are preventing the build from running. Let me create a comprehensive phase prompt to address all catalog-related issues systematically.

COMPREHENSIVE CATALOG SYSTEM REFINEMENT PHASE PROMPT
MISSION STATEMENT
Perform a complete end-to-end audit, repair, and optimization of the ThreadCraft catalog system. Address every route, component, image handling aspect, CRUD operation, error boundary, and user interaction flow to create a bulletproof, production-ready catalog management system.

PHASE 1: CRITICAL ERROR RESOLUTION (IMMEDIATE)
1.1 Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors
Target Files: client/src/components/error/index.ts, client/src/hooks/useErrorBoundary.ts
Issue: JSX syntax in TypeScript files causing build failures
Action: Convert JSX components to proper TypeScript/React patterns
client/src/components/error/index.ts
client/src/hooks/useErrorBoundary.ts
1.2 Fix Import Dependencies in Error Files
PHASE 2: CATALOG API ROUTES COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT
2.1 Catalog Routes Bulletproofing
File: server/routes/api/catalogRoutes.ts
Issues: Field mapping inconsistencies, error handling gaps, authentication edge cases
Actions: Standardize all CRUD operations, fix field transformations, add comprehensive validation
server/routes/api/catalogRoutes.ts
2.2 Enhanced Create Catalog Item Validation
PHASE 3: CATALOG FRONTEND COMPONENT OPTIMIZATION
3.1 CatalogPage Component Performance and Error Handling
client/src/pages/admin/CatalogPage.tsx
3.2 Enhanced Image Upload and Management
PHASE 4: CATALOG SERVICE OPTIMIZATION
4.1 CatalogService Error Handling and Data Processing
server/services/catalogService.ts
PHASE 5: IMAGE HANDLING SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION
5.1 Update Workflow Configuration for Development
Set
Catalog Development Server
to run
npm run dev
PHASE 6: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING AND VALIDATION
6.1 Create Comprehensive Catalog Test Suite
tests/catalog-comprehensive.spec.js
SUCCESS CRITERIA CHECKLIST
✅ Build System: TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ API Routes: All CRUD operations bulletproofed with validation
✅ Error Handling: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
✅ Image System: Unified upload and management system
✅ Data Processing: Null-safe transformations and validation
✅ Performance: Query optimization and caching strategies
✅ Testing: Comprehensive test coverage for all workflows
✅ User Experience: Smooth onboarding and interaction flows

This comprehensive phase addresses every aspect of the catalog system from the ground up, ensuring production-ready reliability and performance.
