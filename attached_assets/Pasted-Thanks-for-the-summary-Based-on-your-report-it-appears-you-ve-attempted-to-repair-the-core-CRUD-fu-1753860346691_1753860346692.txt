Thanks for the summary. Based on your report, it appears you've attempted to repair the core CRUD functionality and restore essential application features.

Please now verify each of your claims against the actual codebase and provide explicit, code-level proof that the fixes have been applied and are working.

Use the structure below to validate each operation:

---

🔍 1. **Customer Creation (AddCustomerForm.tsx + customerRoutes.ts)**

- Show updated form field mappings (e.g., `first_name`, `last_name`, etc.)
- Confirm that the Supabase insert logic uses correct field names
- Prove that the API route properly handles `req.body` and inserts into `customers` table
- Show the exact database query or Supabase call now used

✅ Only mark this complete if the form works *end-to-end* with no schema mismatches or silent failures

---

🔍 2. **Catalog Item Creation (AddCatalogItemForm.tsx + catalogRoutes.ts)**

- Show the full structure of the newly created form component
- List all form fields and how they map to the `catalog_items` table
- Confirm that the backend endpoint `/api/catalog/create` accepts and correctly inserts the catalog item
- Prove that the endpoint performs validation and returns success/failure properly

✅ Only mark complete if both frontend form and backend route now support working catalog item creation

---

🔍 3. **Manufacturer Creation (AddManufacturerForm.tsx + manufacturingRoutes.ts)**

- Show the form component and its input field structure
- Confirm manufacturer creation logic on the backend inserts into the correct table
- Are manufacturers linked to `user_profiles` or another table?
- Validate that the route is wired to the frontend and not just sitting unused

✅ Only mark complete if a manufacturer can be created and viewed in the system

---

🔍 4. **Order Creation (orderRoutes.ts)**

- Show changes to order creation route logic
- Confirm it now validates input fields
- Are nested `order_items` being inserted successfully?
- What happens on invalid data — is the error handled?

✅ Only mark this fixed if a real order can be created with items and linked to a valid customer

---

🔍 5. **Circuit Breaker (fetchCircuitBreaker.ts)**

- Show the updated code that disables or relaxes the circuit breaker in development
- Confirm that fetch requests are no longer blocked after 2–3 retries
- Is it environment-gated properly (e.g., `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`)?

---

### 📊 Final Validation Summary

For each of the above, return:

- ✅ Fully Fixed and Working
- ⚠️ Partially Fixed (describe what’s missing)
- ❌ Not Fixed / No Change

### 🧠 Important Clarification

You’ve claimed all CRUD flows are operational now. However, based on prior history, we’ve seen cases where infrastructure was created but **not connected or functional**.

Please be explicit: if a form or endpoint exists but is not currently functional (e.g., not called by UI, has no validation, can’t be submitted), mark it as **⚠️ or ❌.**

This is a trust-but-verify checkpoint. Our build phase depends on this being accurate.
