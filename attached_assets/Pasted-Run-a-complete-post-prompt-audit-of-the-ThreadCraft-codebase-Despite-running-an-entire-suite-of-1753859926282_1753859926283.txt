Run a complete, post-prompt audit of the ThreadCraft codebase.

Despite running an entire suite of Agent fix prompts, **none of the core data creation features work**. This includes:

‚ùå Adding Customers  
‚ùå Creating Orders  
‚ùå Adding Manufacturers  
‚ùå Adding Catalog Items  

From a user standpoint, the system appears unchanged ‚Äî the same network errors, data creation failures, and broken form flows persist. No meaningful fix has been observed across any of the features that were targeted.

You must now verify whether the Agent:

1. Made any actual changes to the codebase
2. Applied those changes correctly in the right files
3. Fully implemented each fix prompt‚Äôs goal
4. Resolved **any** of the previously audited failures

### üîé Please answer the following in order:

### 1. **Agent Change Log**
- List all files that were modified by the Agent since the last verified audit
- Show code diffs or describe what was changed, per file
- If no changes were made to core files (`AddCustomerForm.tsx`, `orderRoutes.ts`, etc.), confirm that explicitly

---

### 2. **Fix Prompt Impact Validation**
For each of the following areas, report:

#### a. Add Customer  
- Was the form submission logic changed?  
- Is Supabase insert logic correct now?  
- Do schema mismatches still exist (e.g. `firstName` vs `first_name`)?

#### b. Add Catalog Item  
- Was form validation patched?  
- Is the item correctly stored in Supabase with image and variant data?

#### c. Add Manufacturer  
- Was any backend route updated to support manufacturer creation?  
- Is the frontend form correctly wired?

#### d. Create Order  
- Were order creation endpoints or form components changed?  
- Is nested item insertion working (`order_items`, totals, etc.)?

For each:  
‚úÖ Fully Fixed  
‚ö†Ô∏è Attempted but Incomplete  
‚ùå Not Attempted / No Change

### 3. **Codebase Functionality Score**
Recalculate the project‚Äôs actual working functionality as a percentage.

- What percentage of critical features are currently working as expected?
- What percentage of the system is actively broken or unusable?
- What is the new adjusted grade (A‚ÄìF) for production readiness?

### 4. **Next Required Fixes ‚Äì Top 3 (Non-Negotiable)**
Based on what‚Äôs still broken:
- List the 3 most urgent fixes needed to make **any** part of the system usable again.
- Focus on establishing baseline functionality ‚Äî not enhancements.

### 5. **Strategic Recommendations**
Given the complete failure of the Agent prompts to deliver working code:
- Should we re-ru
