Please perform a complete database schema integrity check for the ThreadCraft application.

Verify the following:

---

### ✅ TABLE PRESENCE

Confirm that the following tables exist:

- user_profiles  
- customers  
- catalog_items  
- catalog_categories  
- catalog_sports  
- catalog_fabrics  
- orders  
- order_items  
- design_tasks  
- production_tasks  
- manufacturers (or manufacturers_view if merged into user_profiles)  
- user_invitations  
- messages  
- image_assets (if used)  
- activity_logs (optional, but referenced in some UI logic)

---

### 🧩 COLUMN INTEGRITY

For each table, confirm:

- Primary key is present and correctly typed (UUID or SERIAL)
- All referenced fields in code are present (e.g., `profile_image_url`, `fabric_id`, `images`, `metadata`)
- All foreign key references exist and are valid (e.g., `orders.customer_id → customers.id`)
- All columns referenced in frontend forms or backend handlers exist (use actual field names, not assumptions)

---

### ⚙️ FIELD TYPES AND DEFAULTS

- Are all numeric fields typed correctly (e.g., base_price NUMERIC(10, 2))?
- Are created_at and updated_at timestamp fields present with default values?
- Do enum fields like `order_status`, `task_status`, `payment_status`, and `message_status` exist and match expected values?

---

### 🔒 RELATIONSHIP ENFORCEMENT

- Do all foreign keys enforce ON DELETE CASCADE where needed?
- Are optional fields nullable?
- Are enum and constraint checks active (e.g., `status` IN 'active', 'inactive')?

---

### 🔐 RLS CHECK (OPTIONAL)

- Are RLS policies currently enabled?
- Are the relevant policies applied for user_profiles, customers, orders, catalog_items?

---

📋 Output Format:

- ✅ Table verified  
- ⚠️ Partial — missing fields or weak constraints  
- ❌ Missing or broken — table or key not found

For each issue found, include:

- Table and column name  
- What’s missing or wrong  
- Suggested SQL fix (optional)  

This audit will be used to finalize DB cleanup and unlock full app stability.
