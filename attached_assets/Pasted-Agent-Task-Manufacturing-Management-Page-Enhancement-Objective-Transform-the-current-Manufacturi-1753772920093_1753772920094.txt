Connect to existing orders table with nested order_items
Reference catalog_items data through order items relationships
Utilize production_tasks and design_tasks tables
Link manufacturer profiles from user_profiles where role='manufacturer'
Track communication history through messages table
Management Table Structure should display:

Associated catalog items with manufacturing specifications
Assigned manufacturer details
Production task status and timeline
Communication logs and action items
Priority levels and due dates
Supply Chain Organization Features:

Drag-and-drop task prioritization
Bulk manufacturer assignment
Production queue visualization
