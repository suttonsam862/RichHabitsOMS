Critical Database & Authentication Issues
1. Row Level Security (RLS) Infinite Recursion
Issue: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "user_profiles"
Impact: Prevents user profile creation/updates, breaking authentication flow
Fix Required: Rewrite RLS policies to eliminate circular dependencies
2. Missing Dashboard Stats Endpoint
Issue: 404 NOT FOUND ERROR: /api/dashboard/stats
Impact: Admin dashboard fails to load statistics
Fix Required: Implement dashboard statistics API endpoint
3. Supabase Admin API Access Denied
Issue: AuthApiError: User not allowed with code not_admin
Impact: Cannot fetch user lists, manufacturer data incomplete
Fix Required: Configure proper service role authentication
Catalog-Specific Critical Issues
4. Delete Function Non-Operational
Issue: User reported "delete function in the catalog does not work"
Impact: Cannot remove catalog items
Fix Required: Debug and fix delete mutation in CatalogPage.tsx
5. Inconsistent Data Transformation
Issue: Mixed camelCase/snake_case between frontend and database
Impact: Data corruption, display errors
Fix Required: Standardize data transformation layer
6. Image Upload Error Handling
Issue: No proper error handling for failed image uploads
Impact: Silent failures, orphaned database records
Fix Required: Implement comprehensive upload error handling
7. SKU Validation Race Conditions
Issue: Multiple SKU generation attempts without proper conflict resolution
Impact: Potential duplicate SKUs, validation failures
Fix Required: Implement atomic SKU generation with database constraints
Frontend Integration Flaws
8. Form State Management Issues
Issue: Form doesn't properly reset after successful submission
Impact: Stale data in forms, user confusion
Fix Required: Implement proper form state cleanup
9. Missing Category/Sport Validation
Issue: Frontend validates against local state, not database reality
Impact: Users can submit invalid categories/sports
Fix Required: Server-side validation for all dropdowns
10. Inconsistent Loading States
Issue: Some operations lack proper loading indicators
Impact: Users don't know if operations are in progress
Fix Required: Implement consistent loading states across all operations
Security & Validation Gaps
11. Insufficient Input Sanitization
Issue: JSON specifications field accepts any input without validation
Impact: Potential code injection, data corruption
Fix Required: Implement strict JSON schema validation
12. Missing File Type Validation
Issue: Image upload only checks file extension, not actual content
Impact: Security vulnerability, potential malicious uploads
Fix Required: Implement proper MIME type validation
13. Weak Authentication Token Handling
Issue: Token validation inconsistent across routes
Impact: Authentication bypass possibilities
Fix Required: Standardize token validation middleware
Performance & Scalability Issues
14. Inefficient Query Patterns
Issue: Multiple unnecessary database calls for dropdown data
Impact: Slow page loads, excessive database load
Fix Required: Implement proper data fetching optimization
15. No Pagination Implementation
Issue: Loads all catalog items regardless of count
Impact: Poor performance with large datasets
Fix Required: Implement server-side pagination
16. Missing Database Indexes
Issue: No indexes on frequently queried fields (SKU, category, sport)
Impact: Slow search and filter operations
Fix Required: Add appropriate database indexes
Data Integrity Issues
17. Cascading Delete Problems
Issue: No proper handling of foreign key relationships on delete
Impact: Orphaned records, data integrity violations
Fix Required: Implement proper cascading delete logic
18. Price Precision Issues
Issue: Decimal handling inconsistent between frontend and database
Impact: Price calculation errors, financial discrepancies
Fix Required: Standardize decimal precision handling
19. Missing Audit Trail
Issue: No tracking of catalog item changes
Impact: Cannot track who changed what and when
Fix Required: Implement comprehensive audit logging
User Experience Critical Flaws
20. Poor Error Messages
Issue: Generic error messages don't help users understand problems
Impact: Users can't resolve issues independently
Fix Required: Implement specific, actionable error messages
21. Sorting Logic Incomplete
Issue: Sports icons and category grouping not fully implemented
Impact: Poor visual organization, hard to navigate
Fix Required: Complete sorting and icon implementation
22. Mobile Responsiveness Issues
Issue: Form layouts break on smaller screens
Impact: Unusable on mobile devices
Fix Required: Implement proper responsive design
Critical Business Logic Failures
23. Measurement Requirements Validation
Issue: Can mark items as requiring measurements without providing instructions
Impact: Orders fail due to missing measurement data
Fix Required: Enforce measurement requirements validation
24. Manufacturer Assignment Logic
Issue: Preferred manufacturer selection doesn't handle edge cases
Impact: Production assignments fail
Fix Required: Implement robust manufacturer assignment logic
25. Category/Sport Management Inconsistency
Issue: Can create categories/sports that don't sync across all dropdowns
Impact: Data inconsistency, user confusion
Fix Required: Implement proper state management for dynamic options
