  - File size limits (5MB)
  - Image variant generation (thumbnail, medium, large)
  - Error handling: invalid types, oversized files
  - Edge cases: empty files, special filenames, concurrent uploads

#### 5. Manufacturer Assignment Tests (`manufacturer-assignment.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Test manufacturer assignment and production management
- **Framework**: Jest + Supertest
- **Coverage**:
  - Manufacturer workload tracking
  - Order assignment/unassignment
  - Production task creation and management
  - Dashboard analytics and utilization calculations
  - Workload management with capacity constraints
  - Edge cases: over-capacity assignments, zero capacity manufacturers
  - Complex scenarios: bulk assignments, reassignments

### End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)

#### 6. Complete Workflow E2E Tests (`complete-workflow.spec.js`)
- **Purpose**: Test full user workflows from login to completion
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Coverage**:
  - Complete workflow: Customer → Catalog → Order → Manufacturer Assignment
  - Error handling during workflow interruption
  - Invalid data handling and validation
  - Performance testing across multiple pages
  - Concurrent user simulation
  - Mobile responsive workflow testing
  - Authentication and navigation flows

## Test Features

### Mock Service Worker (MSW) Integration
- **Client Tests**: Use MSW to mock API responses
- **Benefits**: Isolated testing, predictable responses, network error simulation
- **Coverage**: All CRUD operations, error scenarios, edge cases

### React Query Integration
- **Setup**: Custom QueryClient for testing
- **Features**: Disabled retries for faster tests, proper cleanup
- **Testing**: Loading states, error states, cache invalidation

### Authentication Context Testing
- **Mock Auth**: Simulated authentication states
- **Role Testing**: Different user roles and permissions
- **Session Management**: Login/logout workflows

### Comprehensive Error Scenarios
- **Network Errors**: 500, 404, timeout responses
- **Validation Errors**: Required fields, format validation
- **Business Logic Errors**: Duplicate records, invalid states
- **Edge Cases**: Extremely long inputs, special characters, boundary values

## Edge Cases Covered

### Data Validation
- **Email Formats**: Invalid email patterns, international domains
- **Text Fields**: Maximum length validation, special characters, Unicode support
- **Numeric Fields**: Negative values, zero values, extremely large numbers
- **Date Fields**: Invalid formats, past/future dates, timezone handling

### File Upload Edge Cases
- **File Types**: Valid (JPEG, PNG, WebP) and invalid (GIF, PDF, video) formats
- **File Sizes**: Empty files, oversized files (>5MB), exactly at limit
- **File Names**: Special characters, very long names, no extensions
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Multiple simultaneous uploads, race conditions

### Business Logic Edge Cases
- **Inventory**: Zero quantity orders, negative unit prices
- **Capacity**: Over-capacity manufacturer assignments, zero capacity handling
- **Status Transitions**: Invalid status changes, missing required fields
- **Relationships**: Orders without customers, items without catalogs

### UI/UX Edge Cases
- **Empty States**: No data scenarios, loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile viewport testing, touch interactions
- **Performance**: Large data sets, slow network simulation
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility

## Test Data Management

### Dynamic Test Data
- **Unique Identifiers**: Timestamp-based IDs to prevent conflicts
- **Isolated Tests**: Each test creates its own data
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after each test

### Realistic Data Patterns
- **International Names**: Unicode characters, various languages
- **Business Data**: Realistic company names, addresses, phone formats
- **Product Data**: Authentic SKU patterns, pricing ranges

## Test Execution
