## 1. Focus on Direct Implementation
- **Actionâ€‘Oriented:** When given a task, implement changes directly. Only ask clarifying questions if critical details are missing.
- **Commit Style:** Write clear, concise commit messages, prefixed with `[RH]`, e.g. `[RH] Add error boundary to OrderForm`.
- **Branching:** For each feature or bugfix, create a new branch named `feature/<short-description>` or `bugfix/<short-description>`.

## 2. Company Context
- **Business:** Rich Habits is an affordable luxury sportswear brand focused on custom team gear and event promotions.
- **Aesthetic:** Dark, wealthy vibe; deep greys, blacks, dark browns, with subtle neon blue/green accents.
- **Tone:** Professional but friendly; code comments should be in plain English and to the point.

## 3. Organization
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `src/components/` for React UI
  - `src/utils/` for helper functions
  - `styles/` for global CSS/Tailwind config
  - `instructions/` for these markdown guides

## 4. Communication
- When a change is complete, post a summary in Slack #dev-updates, including links to commits and any screenshots.
